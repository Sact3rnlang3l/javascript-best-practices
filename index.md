Good bestest javascript practices:
1. Keep Variable Names Reasonable- Not long, but not something that no one else can understand, I prefer Hungarian style, W3 and Thinkful
2. Use Local Variables, Avoid var(). sitepoint, Thinkful, w3
3. aSync for Promises, Don't lknow yet, but both deepsource and sitepoint
4. Modularize- use Modules instead of a genearl catch all code. w3 and sitepoint
5. Strict code/ Code linting, be strict with your code, don't settle for the worst option. w3 and sitepoint
6. Comment your code, but not tooooooo much. tutsplus
7. use [] instead of array() tutsplus
8. use shortcut notations w3
9. understand and use optional chaining to asve time
10. use Arror functions for a cleaner chain.
